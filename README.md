# 🔌 AI Infrastructure Accountability Engine: Scope & Operations

## 🎯 CLEAR SCOPE
The **AI Infrastructure Accountability Engine** is an autonomous platform designed to audit the gap between corporate sustainability promises and financial reality.

* **Extraction:** Autonomously parses public sustainability targets (e.g., "Net-Zero Data Centers by 2030") from ESG reports.
* **Validation:** Cross-references claims against verifiable **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** on physical compute infrastructure.
* **Consultancy:** Calculates the **Compute-to-Carbon Gap**.
* **Output:** Generates a three-pillar CapEx reallocation plan (**Hardware Upgrades, Power Procurement, Workload Optimization**) to help enterprises scale AI training sustainably while protecting valuation and avoiding regulatory fines.
